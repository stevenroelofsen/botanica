# BOTANICA

Botanica is a small tower defense game made during the hackzurich2018 event, over the span of 20 hours. It is written in javascript and uses [Hexi](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi) as graphic engine. Simply clone Hexi in the root directoy next to index.html. Hexi needs a webserver to host the webpage.
